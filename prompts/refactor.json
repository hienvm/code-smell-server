Please refactor the method to remove the Complex Conditional code smell. Possible methods are moving parts of the code into a new method, breaking the complex conditional statement into simpler statements, moving logical expressions into separate variables etc. You can also come up with your own idea and improve the code in your own way, as long as the Complex Conditional code smell is removed.
